Intro:
This program converts hOCR files into a corpus that can be opened in poliqarp (http://poliqarp.sourceforge.net/).
It treats information about fonts as grammatical categories, enabling a user to query the corpus by this information.

Usage:
./font_sensitive.py corpus_name list_of_filenames_to_convert
e.g.: ./font_sensitive.py my_corpus filename1.xml filename2.xml filename3.xml

Requirements:
bpng (poliqarp.sourceforge.net/man/bpng.html) must be installed
